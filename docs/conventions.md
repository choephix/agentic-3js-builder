# Conventions

The behaviours and conventions to know before building with the SDK. Each answer is checked against `src/`. The API reference is [`api.md`](api.md).

## Handedness and frames

- Model space is +Y up, the model faces +Z, and its left is +X. A viewer facing the model sees its left (+X) on their right.
- With the default roll, local +X of every SDK frame (joints, chain points, hits, parts aimed along "y") points as close to the model's **right** (world −X) as it can. So `head.local([0.1, 0, 0])` on a head aimed forward is 10 cm to the model's right, and in `for (const s of [1, -1])` over `head.local([s * x, y, z])`, `s = 1` is the right side.
- Where local +Z points depends on where the frame's +Y points: forward → +Z up; down → +Z forward; up → +Z back; backward → +Z down; straight sideways → +Z world up.
- `hit.local([x, y, z])`: y is out along the normal `n`. On the front, top or back of a body, x runs toward the model's right and z runs along the surface (up on a front hit, back on a top hit). On a side hit (n ≈ ±X) the fallback applies: z is world up and x runs forward on the left side (n = +X) and backward on the right. `hit.moved([0, d, 0])` is `d` out along the normal.

| Handle             | Where it sits        | +Y (its `axis`)    | +Z                                | +X           | Fields                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chain.at(t)`      | on the centreline    | tangent            | transported `normal`              | `binormal`   | `.at` (point), `.bone` (joint), `.t`, `.normal`, `.binormal` |
| `sweep.at(t, deg)` | on the built surface | outward normal `n` | `tangent`                         | n × tangent  | `.at`, `.n`, `.tangent`, `.radius`, `.t`, `.bone`            |
| ring item          | on the circle        | `outward`          | leans toward the line's direction | —            | `.i`, `.t`, `.outward`, `.bone`                              |
| `Hit`              | on the built surface | `n`                | default roll                      | default roll | `.at`, `.n`, `.mesh`, `.bone`                                |

A `ChainPoint` has no `.joint` or `.position`; read `.bone` for the joint and `.at` for the point. `b.spike(p, p, len, r)` stands along each handle's +Y: along the chain on a chain point, straight out of the skin on a sweep point or hit.

**Angles around a line** all turn the same way: right-handed about the direction of travel, which is clockwise seen looking along it. On a tube running toward +Z, 0 is up and 90 is −X.

- `sweep.at(t, deg)`, `sweep.line(deg)`, `sectors` and paint `s[1]`: 0 is the side facing world up. On a vertical stretch 0 is the tube's normal side (back on a tube running up, front on a tube running down), kept continuous along the whole path.
- `b.ring(line)`: 0 is the direction closest to world up; on a vertical line it is world +Z (front).
- `b.lathe` paint `s[1]`: 0 is the lathe frame's local +Z, 90 its local +X. On the default upright axis that is 0 = back (−Z), 90 = the model's right (−X), 180 = front, 270 = left.

## Placing geometry with `b.part`

- The geometry's origin goes to `at`, else to `frame`'s point, else to the bone's joint. With `bone` and no `at`, geometry you already built in model space lands shifted by the joint's position.
- For geometry whose vertices are already in model space (translated, merged), pass `at: [0, 0, 0]` together with `bone`, and no orientation option:

```ts
b.part(merged, BRASS, { bone: head, at: [0, 0, 0] }); // vertices stay exactly where you put them
```

- Pair `at: [0, 0, 0]` with `bone`: without `bone`, the part goes to the joint nearest the model origin.

### One part per bone and colour

Every mesh counts as a part (limit 1000). Many small static pieces on one bone with one colour belong in one part: place each copy in model space, merge, and add the result once.

```ts
import { mergeGeometries } from "three/addons/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js";
const studs = rivets.map((p) => new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.01, 6, 4).translate(p.x, p.y, p.z));
b.part(mergeGeometries(studs), BRASS, { bone: body, at: [0, 0, 0] });
```

`mergeGeometries` needs every input to carry the same attributes and to be all indexed or all non-indexed (three.js geometries are indexed); otherwise it returns null. Group by bone, colour (or paint) and texture: one merged part per combination.

## Tube sections and radius

- `section: { ngon: n }` puts a **vertex** on the tube's normal side, at exactly `r`. Its flat faces sit at `r · cos(180°/n)`, so they dip `r · (1 − cos(180°/n))` inside the radius: 29% for 4, 19% for 5, 13% for 6, 8% for 8. An even ngon also has a vertex opposite; an odd one has a flat face there.
- `sides: n` (a circle, optionally `smooth: false`) puts a **flat face** on the normal side, at exactly `r`; its vertices reach `r / cos(180°/n)`. An even count also has a flat face opposite, so a tube of radius r whose axis is at height r rests flat on the floor; an odd count has a vertex opposite.
- The normal side is the frame's +Z (see the table above): up on tubes running forward or sideways, front on tubes running down, back on tubes running up, down on tubes running backward. `up:` on a path sweep sets it.

| Section (horizontal tube, radius 0.1) | top             | bottom          | sides           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `sides: 4`                            | face at 0.100   | face at 0.100   | face at 0.100   |
| `sides: 5`                            | face at 0.100   | vertex at 0.124 | 0.118           |
| `{ ngon: 4 }`                         | vertex at 0.100 | vertex at 0.100 | vertex at 0.100 |
| `{ ngon: 5 }`                         | vertex at 0.100 | face at 0.081   | 0.095           |
| `{ ngon: 6 }`                         | vertex at 0.100 | vertex at 0.100 | face at 0.087   |

- `radius: [r0, r1]` is a linear taper from the start to the end of the swept range, never an ellipse. An ellipse is a function returning a pair: `() => [0.2, 0.1]` is 0.2 sideways (binormal) by 0.1 along the normal; `(t) => [rx(t), ry(t)]` varies it. `number[]` with three or more keys is a smooth taper over the swept range.

## Ends of tubes

- `caps: "round"` adds a dome of the end radius beyond the path end; `caps: "point"` adds a cone whose tip sits one end radius (the larger of rx, ry) beyond the path end. A tube whose end radius is 0 (`[r, 0]`, `b.spike`) ends exactly at the path end with either cap. For a point that lands exactly on a target, taper the radius to 0 or end the path one end radius short.
- `extend` continues the tube straight past the end at the end radius; the extension carries the end's `t` in paints.
- Closed paths (`closed: true`, swept whole): where the path's end meets its start smoothly (within 20°), the tube is welded into a loop with no caps. Where the seam is a corner (a closed polyline), both ends get round caps that overlap at the corner.

## Paint surface coordinates `s`

A paint `(p, n, s) => colour` gets `p` (model-space point, in the pose where the part was built), `n` (unit outward normal) and `s`, the part's own coordinates. Each texel reads `s` interpolated across its triangle.

| Shape                                    | `s`                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sweep, loft, rod, capsule, spike, sprout | `[t, deg]`: source t (the t of the path or chain you swept), and the dorsal clock angle (0 = world up, 90 = clockwise looking along the tube) |
| `extrude`                                | `[x, y]`: the outline's coordinates in meters, on the faces **and** the side walls                                                            |
| `lathe`                                  | `[height, deg]`: the outline's y in meters, and the angle round the axis (see "Angles around a line")                                         |
| `membrane`                               | `[along, across]`: 0..1 along the edges from their start, 0 at edge A to 1 at edge B                                                          |
| `slab`                                   | `[x, y]`: meters from the polygon's centre in its plane, y leaning toward world up                                                            |
| `part`, `stick` (three.js geometry)      | the geometry's `uv` (0..1)                                                                                                                    |
| geometry without `uv`                    | `[0, 0]`                                                                                                                                      |

### Sweeps and lofts

- `deg` sits on the world-up clock, like `sectors`. `twist` rolls the section but leaves the clock where it is: a twisted tube paints exactly like an untwisted one. A spiral stripe is a condition on both coordinates: `(((s[1] - 720 * s[0]) % 90) + 90) % 90 < 20` draws four stripes that each wind twice round the tube.
- On a tilted tube 0 is its most upward side; through vertical stretches the clock stays continuous, so a coil keeps its belly on one side.
- Round and point caps take the end's `t` on every vertex (`from` or `to`, usually 0 or 1) and the clock angle round the axis. A pattern keyed to `t` therefore stops at the cap and the whole dome takes one colour. To run a pattern over the tip, key it to the distance along the end tangent:

```ts
const end = path.at(1);
const T = path.tangentAt(1);
const tipBands = paint((p) => (Math.floor((p.clone().sub(end).dot(T) + 1) / 0.04) % 2 ? DARK : PALE));
```

`gradient(a, b, from, to)` does the same projection for a soft blend (a dark tail tip: `gradient(COAT, DARK, path.at(0.8), path.at(1))`).

- Closed sweeps: t runs 0 → 1 from the path's start round to the start again. In the last ring gap before the start, `s[0]` is interpolated from about 1 back down to 0, so a pattern keyed to `t` shows a smeared band there. Key rims, collars and straps to `deg` or to `p`, or place the path's start where the smear is hidden.

### Extrude walls and faces

The side walls sit on the outline, so a wall texel reads the same `[x, y]` as the edge of the face it borders, and a pattern in `s` runs straight across the wall. Tell them apart by the normal: the faces' normal is along the thickness axis `x × y`, the walls' normal is square to it.

```ts
const thick = new THREE.Vector3(...X).cross(new THREE.Vector3(...Y)).normalize(); // the directions you pass as x and y
const fin = paint((_p, n, s) => (Math.abs(n.dot(thick)) < 0.5 ? RIM : s[1] > 0.1 ? TIP : BASE));
```

### Mirrored extrudes

The part's local +z (its facing `axis`, the thickness direction) is `x × y`. Mirroring one of the two directions flips it relative to the mirrored side:

- `x: [s, 0, 0]` (outline drawn along X, y up): +z is world +Z for `s = 1` and world −Z for `s = −1`.
- `x: [0, 0, 1], y: [s * 0.3, 1, 0]`: +z points toward world −X on both sides, so it is the outer face on the right and the inner face on the left.

Pick the face from the axis and the direction you want it to face. For fins standing out sideways, `const out = fin.axis.dot(new THREE.Vector3(s, 0, 0)) > 0 ? 1 : -1; fin.local([u, v, (out * t) / 2])` is on the face pointing away from the mid-plane on both sides.

## Cards

A card stands on its frame: its root (the drawing's bottom edge, v = 0) sits on the frame point and it grows along the frame's facing axis. `flow` is flattened onto the plane square to that axis; if it is parallel to the axis, −Z is used (then +X).

- **Facing.** Upright cards (`lean: 0`) lie in the plane of the facing axis and the card's width, and face along `flow`. With the default flow (`[0, -0.3, -1]`) on an upward frame, standing cards face front and back and are edge-on from the side.
- **Which side reads unmirrored.** Seen from downstream (from the side `flow` points to, looking back), the drawing reads as drawn. From upstream it is mirrored. `mirror: true` swaps the two.
- **`lean`** (degrees) tips the card from the facing axis toward `flow`: 0 stands straight out, 90 lies along the surface pointing downstream, 180 points back along the axis. Negative values lean upstream.
- **`bend`** curls each card further in the lean direction from root to tip: positive curls toward `flow`, negative away from it.
- **`sink`** (default 0.1) moves the root back along the card's starting direction by that share of its length (into the surface for a standing card, upstream along it for a flat one), then out along the facing axis by 2% of the length.
- **`cross: true`** adds a second card through the same spine, turned 90° about it.
- **Lighting.** Every card vertex takes the frame's facing axis as its normal, on both sides. A card on a frame facing down shades like the underside of something: dark.
- **Hanging cards** (tassels, icicles, moss): put the frame at the attachment point facing **up** and use `lean: 180`. The card hangs straight down and shades like an upward surface. Seen from downstream it shows the drawing upside down (root edge on top), not mirrored.

```ts
b.cards(
  knots.map((p) => frame(p, [0, 1, 0])),
  tassel,
  { size: [0.03, 0.12], lean: 180, flow: [0, 0, 1] },
);
```

- **Flat, lit from above** (lily pads, fallen leaves, floor decals): frame facing up and `lean: 90`. The card lies along `flow`, the drawing's top toward `flow`. Seen from above it is mirrored, so add `mirror: true`.

```ts
b.cards([frame([0.3, 0.001, 0.2], [0, 1, 0])], leaf, { size: 0.12, lean: 90, flow: [1, 0, 0], mirror: true });
```

- `color` tints cards with one colour, or reads a Paint once at each card's root (one colour per card).

## Textures

- A textured `part` or `stick` shows its **front faces only**: from behind, a `PlaneGeometry` is invisible. For a drawing seen from both sides, use a card. `color` must be a colour string tint ("#ffffff" keeps the drawing).
- `PlaneGeometry` and `CircleGeometry` face their local +Z and show the whole drawing upright along +Y. Place one with `dir` and `axis: "z"`: `b.part(new THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.1, 0.1), "#ffffff", { at, dir: [0, 0, 1], axis: "z", texture })`.
- `BoxGeometry` shows the whole drawing on each of its six faces.
- `SphereGeometry` wraps the drawing round once: its seam is at local −X, u = 0.25 at +Z, the drawing's middle (u = 0.5) at +X, v from the bottom pole to the top, unmirrored from outside. Turn the drawing's middle to face front with `rotation: [0, -90, 0]`. The front half of the sphere shows only the middle half of the drawing, so draw it twice as wide as it should look.
- `svg(markup, { size })` rasterises at `size` pixels on the longest side, clamped to 8..2048: a 4-pixel drawing is rasterised at 8, each drawn pixel becoming 2 × 2.
- Pixels below half opacity are cut away. A stroke's raster width is `strokeWidth × size / viewBoxLongestSide`; keep it at 3 raster pixels or more (a 1-unit stroke in a `0 0 64 64` viewBox wants `size: 192`). Pixel art with `pixelated: true` keeps single pixels drawn as `<rect>`s on the grid.

## Bounding boxes

SDK meshes hang under their bone's joint, with vertices stored in that bone's local frame; tubes over several bones are re-deformed on the CPU after each pose. `new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(obj)` transforms each mesh's local bounding box by its bone and boxes the result, so on any rotated or posed bone it returns a box that is too large (measured: 0.28 m past the true front of a posed tail tube).

Read true bounds with the precise flag, which visits every vertex:

```ts
const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(b.root, true); // exact, in the current pose
```

For a contact point, ask the built surface instead of a box: `b.surface(foot).ray([x, 1, z], [0, -1, 0])` is the first hit straight down, and `sweep.at(t, 180)` is the underside of a tube.

## IK

`limb(root, target, lengths, bends)` returns a chain that ends exactly on `target` when it can reach. When the target is farther than the summed lengths, it returns the limb stretched straight toward the target, ending short of it, without an error. Check the reach when a foot must be planted:

```ts
const pts = limb(hip, foot, [0.3, 0.3], [0, 0, 1]);
if (pts[pts.length - 1].distanceTo(vec(foot)) > 1e-3) throw new Error("leg too short for its foot");
```

## Rig answer key

A chain's or joint's `side` is derived from the x of its joints when `b.root` is read: "L" when every joint is at x > 1 mm, "R" when every joint is at x < −1 mm, "C" otherwise. Start a limb chain off the mid-plane (its first joint at the shoulder or hip socket, not at x = 0), or it records "C".

## Paint sheet and atlas

- `createBuilder({ paintSize })` takes 512, 1024 (default) or 2048; any other value throws. It is the paint sheet's width in texels; the sheet's height is trimmed to what the painted parts use.
- Texel density follows the painted area: about `sqrt(0.7 · paintSize² / total painted area)` texels per meter, at most 4000. Doubling `paintSize` halves the texel size; painting more surface makes every texel larger.
- The exported atlas is the smallest square power of two from 256 to 4096 that holds the flat-colour block, the paint sheet and every texture, each with an 8-texel gutter on every side. So a 512 sheet needs an atlas of at least 1024, 1024 at least 2048, and 2048 an atlas of 4096. When everything does not fit in 4096, every tile, the paint sheet included, is halved until it does. The snap report prints the atlas size.
