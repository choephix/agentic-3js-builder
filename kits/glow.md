# Glow kit

`kits/glow.ts` makes surfaces self-lit: lantern glass, lit windows, embers and fire, glowing eyes, neon tubes,
crystals, runes and magic. A glowing part keeps its own colours and shows them at full brightness whatever the
lighting. It works through the standard three.js `emissive` material properties, which the GLB carries as glTF's
emissive colour and texture, so any engine that imports the GLB sees it. Bloom and halos are the importing
renderer's choice.

```ts
import { glow } from "../kits/glow";
```

## `glow(target, strength = 1)`

`target` is anything built with meshes: a `Part` (from `b.part`, `b.stick`, `b.extrude`, `b.lathe`, ...), a sweep or
loft, the meshes `b.cards` returns, or plain meshes. It returns `target`, so it wraps a call:

```ts
glow(b.part(new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.16, 0.2, 0.16), "#ffb347", { bone: post, at: [0, 1.1, 0] }), 1.5);
glow(b.part(new THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.2, 0.2), "#ffffff", { bone: post, at: [0, 0.6, 0.05], texture: RUNE }));
```

- `strength` 1 shows the part's colours at full brightness; higher values read as brighter light where the renderer
  supports it (the GLB records them with `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`).
- Flat colours glow in that colour. Textured parts and cards glow in their texture's own colours, so a drawing can
  glow in some places and stay dark in others: draw the dark parts dark.
- Only the parts you pass glow; other parts of the same colour stay lit normally.
- Painted surfaces (a `Paint` as `color`) can't glow: give the glowing piece its own part with a flat colour or a
  texture.
- A plain three.js mesh can set `emissive` (the same colour as its `color`) and `emissiveIntensity` on its own
  `MeshStandardMaterial`; that is all `glow` does.
