# Clockwork kit

`kits/clockwork.ts` is for clockwork, steampunk and machine builds: automata, brass animals, gearboxes, carousels,
clocks. It gives you toothed gears as real geometry and as drawings, gear trains whose teeth sit in each other's gaps
and that turn together on their own joints, metal paints and riveted plating, a pressure gauge drawing and a coil-spring
path.

```ts
import {
  coil,
  gaugeTexture,
  gearGeometry,
  gearSize,
  gearTexture,
  gearTrain,
  metal,
  panelled,
  TINT,
} from "../kits/clockwork";
```

Everything here is in meters and model space, like the rest of the SDK.

## Metal paints

### `metal(kind, options?) → Paint`

`kind` is `"brass" | "gilt" | "bronze" | "copper" | "steel" | "blued" | "iron"`. The paint drifts between the metal's
dark and light tone with fine streaks, darkens in tarnish blotches, gathers verdigris on faces turned down and away from
the light, and takes a bright sheen on up-facing surfaces. `"blued"` is heat-tempered steel drifting through straw,
purple and blue.

| Option      | Meaning                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `polish`    | 0..1, sheen on up-facing surfaces (each kind has its own default)        |
| `tarnish`   | 0..1, dark oxidised blotches                                             |
| `verdigris` | 0..1, blue-green patina patches on down-facing faces (default 0)         |
| `size`      | size of the broad colour drift in meters (default 0.07); blotches follow |
| `seed`      | noise seed; parts with one kind and seed continue one field              |

```ts
const BRASS = metal("brass");
const OLD_BRASS = metal("brass", { tarnish: 0.7, verdigris: 0.6, polish: 0.1 });
const GILT = metal("gilt");
const COPPER = metal("copper", { verdigris: 0.4 });
const BLUED = metal("blued");
const IRON = metal("iron");
```

Make one paint per look at module level and reuse it, so parts that share it continue one pattern.

### `panelled(base, options?) → Paint`

Riveted plating over any colour or paint: dark 2.5 mm seams on a grid laid on the dominant face direction (side, top or
front), a bright bevel beside each seam and a row of round rivet heads along it. It works on boxes, lofts, sweeps and
lathes alike.

| Option   | Meaning                                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`   | panel width in meters (default 0.13)                      |
| `aspect` | panel height as a share of its width (default 0.7)        |
| `rivets` | rivet spacing in meters (default 0.03); 0 for plain seams |
| `seam`   | seam colour (default `INK`)                               |

```ts
const HULL = panelled(metal("iron"), { size: 0.12 });
b.loft(stations, { bone: [tail, hips, spine], color: panelled(metal("copper", { verdigris: 0.5 }), { size: 0.1 }) });
```

`INK` (engraving and seam brown-black) and `GLINT` (bevel and rivet highlight) are exported as `Rgb` for your own paints.

## Gear shape

A gear is described by a `GearShape`:

| Field        | Meaning                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teeth`      | tooth count, 8 or more                                                             |
| `module`     | meters; pitch radius = teeth × module / 2. Give `module` or `radius`               |
| `radius`     | pitch radius in meters (the circle two meshing gears roll on)                      |
| `thickness`  | face width along the axle (default 2 × module)                                     |
| `toothDepth` | 0.5..1 share of standard depth (addendum 1 module, dedendum 1.25), default 1       |
| `bore`       | radius of an axle hole through the middle                                          |
| `spokes`     | spoke count: windows between hub and rim (appear when the wheel has room for them) |
| `holes`      | round lightening holes between hub and rim, used when `spokes` is not set          |

Two gears mesh when they share a module and their centres sit `pitchA + pitchB` apart with a tooth of one in a gap of
the other. `gearTrain` does both for you. Any two gears of one module stay clear of each other through a full turn.

### `gearSize(shape) → GearSize`

The dimensions: `{ teeth, module, pitch, outer, root, rim, hub, thickness, plane }`. `pitch` is the pitch radius,
`outer` the tip radius, `root` the bottom of the gaps, `rim` the inner edge of the rim, `hub` the hub radius, and
`plane` the side of the square that `gearTexture` fills.

### `gearGeometry(shape) → BufferGeometry`

The gear as flat-shaded extruded geometry: axle along local +Y, centred on the origin, tooth 0 on local +Z. Place it with
`b.part` and `dir` along the axle:

```ts
const wheel = { teeth: 30, module: 0.006, spokes: 5, bore: 0.006 };
b.part(gearGeometry(wheel), metal("brass"), { bone: chest, at: chest.local([0, 0.05, 0.2]), dir: [0, 0, 1] });
```

A paint's surface coordinate `s` on a gear is the face position in meters from the axle (seen from +Y, tooth 0 up), so
`paint((p, n, s) => (Math.hypot(s[0], s[1]) < 0.02 ? GILT : BRASS))` gilds the hub. Its UVs lay `gearTexture(shape)` over
both faces at scale, so `texture: gearTexture(wheel)` engraves the real gear with its own drawing.

## Gear drawings

### `gearTexture(shape, options?) → Texture`

The drawing of a gear shape, pale grey so a tint colours it: the same teeth, spoke windows, holes and bore as
`gearGeometry` (cut away), a gradient face, engraved rim and hub rings, and a dotted rivet ring on wide rims. Tooth 0
points up. Options: `dots` (default true where the rim has room), `size` (raster pixels, default 256).

Tint it with `TINT`: `{ brass, gilt, bronze, copper, steel, iron }` colour strings.

```ts
const cog = { teeth: 18, module: 0.004, spokes: 4 };
const tex = gearTexture(cog);
const side = gearSize(cog).plane;
b.part(new PlaneGeometry(side, side), TINT.brass, { bone: head, at: cheek, dir: cheekNormal, axis: "z", texture: tex });
b.cards(skin.scatter(40, { rng: rng(3), minDist: 0.05 }), tex, { size: 0.05, lean: 90, color: TINT.copper });
```

A flat gear seen from both sides is two planes back to back or a card; `gearTrain`'s `style: "flat"` builds that for
you.

## Gear trains

### `gearTrain(b, options) → GearTrain`

Lays out and builds a train of meshing gears. `gears[0]` sits at `at`; every other gear either meshes with an earlier
gear (`from`, default the previous one) at `angle`, pitch circles touching and teeth phased into the gaps, or shares an
axle with an earlier gear (`on`) and moves to another layer along the axle with `shift`. Gears that share an axle turn
as one piece, so a small pinion on a big wheel's axle (a compound gear) carries the train into a second plane.

| Option      | Meaning                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `at`        | centre of `gears[0]`                                                                              |
| `axis`      | axle direction of the whole train (a Frame gives its facing axis)                                 |
| `up`        | where angle 0 points in the plane (default world up, world +Z for a vertical axle)                |
| `module`    | module in meters, shared by every gear of the train                                               |
| `gears`     | the `TrainGear` list, below                                                                       |
| `style`     | `"solid"` (default, extruded) or `"flat"` (two textured faces and a rim band per gear)            |
| `thickness` | face width for every gear (default 2 × module)                                                    |
| `color`     | colours cycled over the gears (default brass, copper, gilt, blued steel, bronze; tints when flat) |
| `arbor`     | axle pin colour, or `false` for none (default steel)                                              |
| `spin`      | joint-name prefix: each axle gets its own joint `${spin}1`, `${spin}2`, …, bone +Y along the axle |
| `bone`      | parent of the spin joints, and the bone for every part when there are none                        |
| `group`     | group tag for every joint and part                                                                |

Each `TrainGear` takes the `GearShape` fields except `module`/`radius`, plus:

| Field     | Meaning                                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`    | index of the earlier gear it meshes with (default the previous gear)                      |
| `angle`   | degrees in the train plane from `from`'s centre: 0 along `up`, right-handed about `axis`  |
| `on`      | index of an earlier gear whose axle (and joint) it shares                                 |
| `shift`   | with `on`: meters along the axle from that gear; its own followers mesh in this layer     |
| `phase`   | tooth-0 angle in degrees, for `gears[0]` and `on` gears (meshed gears are phased for you) |
| `color`   | its own colour: a Paint or colour string; a tint string when it is textured               |
| `texture` | `true` for its own `gearTexture` on its faces, or a Texture                               |
| `name`    | joint name for its axle, instead of the numbered one                                      |

Keep a shift at least one face width, so layers clear each other. Two gears in one layer that are not a meshing pair
must clear each other's tips; the train throws naming both gears when they would overlap, so change an `angle` or
`shift` one.

The result is `{ gears, spin(deg) }`. Each entry of `gears` is a `PlacedGear`: `index`, `size` (`GearSize`), `at`
(centre), `frame` (facing the axle, local +Z toward tooth 0), `phase` (degrees), `ratio` (turn rate relative to
`gears[0]`, negative for the opposite direction), `joint` (its axle joint or null) and `parts`. `spin(deg)` poses every
axle joint so `gears[0]` turns `deg` about the axis and every other gear follows its ratio, teeth still in the gaps. An
animator turns joint `i` by `deg × ratio` for the same motion.

```ts
const drive = gearTrain(b, {
  at: chest.local([0, 0.02, 0.18]),
  axis: [0, 0, 1],
  module: 0.008,
  spin: "gear",
  bone: chest,
  group: "body",
  gears: [
    { teeth: 24, spokes: 5 }, // 0: great wheel
    { teeth: 12, angle: 60 }, // 1: pinion, up and to the right
    { teeth: 16, from: 0, angle: -110, holes: 4, color: metal("gilt") }, // 2: off the great wheel, to the left
    { teeth: 28, on: 1, shift: 0.03, spokes: 6, texture: true, color: TINT.brass }, // 3: on 1's axle, front layer
    { teeth: 10, from: 3, angle: 160 }, // 4: meshes 3 in the front layer
  ],
});
drive.spin(12); // a rest pose with the wheels turned a little

gearTrain(b, {
  at: flank,
  axis: [1, 0, 0],
  module: 0.005,
  style: "flat",
  bone: hips,
  gears: [
    { teeth: 20, spokes: 4 },
    { teeth: 14, angle: 120 },
  ],
});
```

`style: "flat"` suits many small gears on a body (cheek wheels, tail trains): each gear is two drawn faces and a rim band,
a few triangles each. `"solid"` suits hero wheels seen edge-on.

## Extras

### `gaugeTexture(options?) → Texture`

A pressure gauge face: cream enamel, a 270° scale of ticks and numerals, a red zone, a label and a hub. Options:
`needle` (degrees, 0 straight up, clockwise positive; leave it out and build the needle as a part on its own joint),
`red` (`[fromDeg, toDeg]`, default `[81, 135]`), `label` (default `"PSI"`), `face` (colour), `size` (default 192).

```ts
b.part(new CylinderGeometry(0.05, 0.05, 0.012, 16), metal("gilt"), { bone: chest, at: dialAt, dir: dialNormal });
b.part(new CircleGeometry(0.043, 24), "#ffffff", {
  bone: chest,
  at: offset(dialAt, dialNormal, 0.007),
  dir: dialNormal,
  axis: "z",
  texture: gaugeTexture({ needle: 60 }),
});
```

### `coil(a, b, radius, turns) → Path`

A coil spring's centreline from `a` to `b`: `turns` turns of `radius` around the a→b line. Sweep it thin.

```ts
b.sweep(coil(hip, knee, 0.025, 8), 0.004, { bone: thigh, color: metal("blued") });
```
